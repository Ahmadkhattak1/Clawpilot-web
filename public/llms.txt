# ClawPilot - LLM Context

> ClawPilot hosts OpenClaw for users who want the power of OpenClaw without setup and maintenance overhead.

## About

ClawPilot runs OpenClaw as a managed service. Users create an account, connect chat tools, and start delegating tasks without managing servers or uptime.

## Key Features

- **Managed Hosting**: No extra machines, no server setup, and no uptime babysitting.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, Teams, and WebChat.
- **Control and Safety**: Users decide what OpenClaw can access and can require confirmation for sensitive actions.
- **Open Source Foundation**: Powered by OpenClaw.

## How It Works

1. Create an account
2. Connect chat and tools
3. Start delegating tasks
